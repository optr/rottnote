# rottnote

This project uses the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node Express API server.

There is a [detailed blog post](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) that explains how initial version of this repository was created.

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/optr/rottnote.git
cd rottnote
npm install

cd client
npm install

cd ..
npm start
```

## Overview

`rottnote` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/public/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

The development environment setup has two web servers, the Webpack dev server (which serves static content) at `localhost:3000` and the rottnote API server (which provides the /notes REST API endpoint) at `localhost:3001`. To avoid CORS issues, the Webpack development server proxies requests intended to the API server, like this:

This setup uses [node-foreman](https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs Foreman to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.
